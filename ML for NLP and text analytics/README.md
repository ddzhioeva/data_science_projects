-To launch a new service, an online store needs a tool that will search for toxic comments and send them for moderation. Users can edit and add product descriptions, just like in community wikis. That is, clients suggest their edits and comment on others' changes. The model was trained to classify comments into positive and negative. Analyzed a dataset with markup on the toxicity of edits. A model with a quality metric F1 of at least 0.75 was built.

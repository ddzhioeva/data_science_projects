# Customer Age Determination
#### Task: 
- Develop a machine learning model capable of estimating the approximate age of a person from a given photo. The project aims to implement a computer vision system in a supermarket's checkout area to determine the age of customers. 
#### Description:
-  A supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo-fixing in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to shoppers of that age group;
Control the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.
A model was built that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. Analyzed a set of photos of people with an indication of age using computer vision using off-the-shelf neural networks and the Keras library.

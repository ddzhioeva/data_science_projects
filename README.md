    <td>Telecom</td>
    <td>A telecommunications company is facing a problem: they need to predict in advance how many customers may churn each month in order to retain them and increase their customer lifetime value (LTV). Such a model would enable the business to plan marketing campaigns and improve the target metric - customer lifetime value - which allows assessing the financial value of a customer.</td>

    <td>The "Non-Accident, Non-Painted" used car sales service aims to provide its customers with an efficient and accurate way to estimate the market value of their vehicles. By leveraging historical data on car technical specifications, configurations, and prices, we can develop a reliable model to predict car prices. This will not only attract new customers to the platform but also enhance their overall experience by providing valuable insights into their car's market value.</td>

    <td>We have been provided data on customers' behavior who have already switched to mobile tariffs.

    <td>Telecom</td>
    <td>We have conducted a marketing research project to determine a good plan for a telecom company. Through preliminary analysis of a sample of customers, we discovered that many of them were using archived rates. By analyzing customers' behavior when using our operator's services, we recommended optimal sets of benefits for users. We also tested hypotheses about the differences in revenue among subscribers on different tariffs and among subscribers from Moscow and other regions. Based on our research, we identified an excellent tariff plan that will allow us to adjust our advertising budget. Additionally, we developed a system that can analyze customer behavior and recommend new tariffs better suited to their needs. To achieve this, we built a classification model with the highest possible accuracy, gaining a share of correct answers of 0.75. We have also verified the accuracy of our model on a test sample. Overall, our research has allowed us to make data-driven decisions to help our telecom company achieve greater profitability and better serve our customers.</td>

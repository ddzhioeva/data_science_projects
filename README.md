    <td>Telecom</td>
    <td>A telecommunications company is facing a problem: they need to predict in advance how many customers may churn each month in order to retain them and increase their customer lifetime value (LTV). Such a model would enable the business to plan marketing campaigns and improve the target metric - customer lifetime value - which allows assessing the financial value of a customer.</td>

    <td>The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model that can accurately predict the age of individuals based on their photos. The dataset contains a collection of photos, each associated with the age of the person depicted in the image. We will utilize various tools and libraries, such as Pandas for data manipulation, Keras for deep learning, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Computer Vision techniques for image analysis.</td>

    <td>Online Service</td>
    <td>The online store "WikiShop" is launching a new service. Now users can edit and enhance product descriptions, similar to wiki communities. In other words, customers can suggest their edits and comment on the changes made by others. The store requires a tool that can detect toxic comments and send them for moderation.</td>

    <td>The company "Cheotenkoe Taxi" has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak load periods, it is necessary to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour.</td>
